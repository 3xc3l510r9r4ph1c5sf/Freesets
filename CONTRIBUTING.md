# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Freesets! You can help us by contributing new resources or improving the website.

You can contribute new resources to Freesets in two different ways:
- [Suggest the resource(s) in discussions.](#suggest-resources)
- [Make a pull request.](#make-a-pull-request)

**Before suggesting a resource make sure that:**
- The resource has at least one free version or free plan.
- The resource is not already in the list.
- There is a category for the resource (if not, you can suggest it in the discussions).

## Suggest resources

Create a [new discussion](https://github.com/cosmoart/free-resources/discussions/new/choose) with the resource(s) according to the [resource structure](#resource-structure). If you want to suggest several resources you can do so in the same discussion, it is not necessary to create a new one for each one.


## Make a pull request

To make a pull request follow the following steps:

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cosmoart/free-resources
```

2. Create your branch

```bash
git checkout -b my-branch
```

3. Make the changues in the website or add your resources to the jsons files in the `source-web/src/assets/data` folder using the [resource structure](#resource-structure).

4. Commit your changes.

```bash
git commit -m "âœ¨ add: 4 icons, 2 fonts and 1 illustration"
```

5. Push to the branch

```bash
git push origin my-branch
```

6. Open a pull request
